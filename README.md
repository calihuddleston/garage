# About Project

If you often travel to bigger cities, you know that it is a STRUGGLE to find available parking spaces. 
It often results in frustration and time lost on the original plan you had for the day!
Thatâ€™s why my team and I created Park Me! So you can conveniently access parking and get back to your day.





# User Story:
 
- As a user I want to search for my destination and access parking garages near by
- So that I can park with ease


# Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN using a web application that allows a user to enter their destination (park, zoo, venue, city, etc.).
- WHEN I enter a destination and click search
- THEN Google Maps generates with location tags with parking garage locations in the surrounding area
- WHEN I hover over a location tag and click on it 
- THEN it takes me to that exact location
