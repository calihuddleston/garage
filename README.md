# :car: Park Me

# About Project

If you often travel to bigger cities, you know that it is a STRUGGLE to find available parking spaces. 
It often results in frustration and time lost on the original plan you had for the day!
That’s why my team and I created Park Me! So you can conveniently access parking and get back to your day.





# User Story:
- As A Driver I WANT to search up a parking garage in different cities on GoogleMap
 
  SO THAT I can find parking nearby

# Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN I am searching for a parking garage in the City
  WHEN I enter a city 
  THEN it takes me to a map with multiple parking garage locations in that City
  WHEN I hover over a parking garage location it takes me to the destination
  THEN I can click on it
