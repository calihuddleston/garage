            <p>Hello, I'm Cali! I'm a first time mom to a wonderful one year old. As a parent I know nothing is more frustrating spending more time trying to find a parking spot vs spending more time doing the thing you wanted to do! So, my team and I created Park Me so you can find parking easier based on where you're trying to go!</p>

            <p>Hello, I'm Esmeralda! I grew up being taught that hard work is what will get you through life so Im a very particular person when it comes getting the job done. With creating Park Me it was a lot easier said than done situation but with everyone's input and support we persevered and made a page that will benefit everyone</p>

            <p>Hello, Iâ€™m Wardeh! for someone who loves going on roadtrips nothing pains me more than wasting time looking for parking spots in bigger cities. With team effort we built a user-friendly application to provide parking locations via GoogleMaps.</p>

            <p>Hello, I'm Donna!  I enjoyed working with such a great team.  Driving to an event in a large city such as Detroit and then trying to find a place to park can be so stressful.  We built this cool app that will help make going to events more enjoyable without the stress.</p>
